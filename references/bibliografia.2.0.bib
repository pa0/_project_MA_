@article{Shoshani2023,
	abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) technology can provide new opportunities to promote prosocial learning in young children. However, little empirical research has examined how this technology can impact preschool children's prosocial behavior. To respond to this need, two experiments investigated how VR prosocial games affect preschool children's prosocial behavior in real-life settings. Positive affect and sense of competence were examined as potential mediators between the VR prosocial play and real-life prosocial behavior. In the first experiment, 4-to 6-year-olds (N = 166) were randomly assigned to play a prosocial, violent, or neutral VR game. After the game, helping behaviors towards the experimenter were tested on a behavioral task. In the second experiment, 4-to 6-year-olds (N = 173) were randomly assigned to a prosocial, positive affect, or neutral VR game condition, and their sharing behavior with peers was examined on a dictator game. Across experiments, children in the pro-social game condition exhibited more helping and sharing behaviors than children in the violent, positive affect, or neutral conditions. Positive affect mediated the effect of VR prosocial play on prosocial behavior; the effect of competence was not significant. The contribution of gamified VR environments to facilitating prosocial development during the preschool age is discussed.},

@phdthesis{Malapaschas2015,
	abstract = {People are often involved in situations where they are required to interact with a group of strangers. The social interaction in these situations can be hindered by several factors, such as a person``s shyness or inhibition, and the lack of common ground. In order to overcome these obstacles, various group activities known as ice-breaking or team-building activities, have been developed and put to use.
 Electronic mobile devices with networking capabilities like tablets and smartphones are nowadays used extensively in everyday life. One of their many use cases is to help people socialize, either by meeting new people or communicating with friends. Additionally, video games have been proven efficient in motivating people to socialize, either by inspiring players to form groups and communities over distance, or by facilitating interaction between collocated people.
 The main objective of this thesis is to design, implement and evaluate an ice-breaking activity for a group of strangers, utilizing the benefits of mobile technology and video games mentioned above. The result was a quiz-based, multi-player, mobile game called Who``s Next, built for mobile devices that run the Android operating system. The Wi-Fi Direct framework was used to establish connection and data exchange between the devices.
 The thesis was written within the borders of the Human-Technology Interaction research field, using the User-Centered Design methodology. Thus, the thesis begins with a theoretical study on video games and their social impact, and the different social relationships and groups between people. Next, a description of traditional ice-breaking activities and their characteristics is presented. Moreover, previous attempts to utilize technology -and mobile devices in particular- in such activities are explored.
 To evaluate the effects of the game as an ice-breaker, a user study with six group sessions of 4 to 5 participants were conducted. The participants`` behaviour during the sessions, as well as their feedback given in an interview afterwards, were examined and analyzed to form conclusions about the appropriateness of the game and the players`` overall user experience. According to the results, Who``s Next was found to be an engaging application that encourages social interaction in a group, and which helps strangers get to know each other. Most participants found it preferable to other ice-breaking activities, since it provided more a comfortable way to share their personal information with a group.},

	abstract = {The pervasiveness of video gaming among adolescents today suggests a need to understand how gaming affects identity formation. We interviewed 20 adolescents about their experiences of playing, asking them to describe how they used games and how game playing affected their real-world selves. Adolescents presented a complicated developmental picture: gaming placed players into virtual worlds that felt ``real''; games were used to practice multiple identities; and gaming, often undertaken within a world of hyperviolence, provided stress relief, feelings of competence, and relaxation. Gaming occurred in complex ``virtual'' but ``real'' social arenas where adolescents gathered to interact, emulate, and develop identities.},

	abstract = {Cooperation is motivated through internal impressions of different situations. This paper hypothesized that playing dynamic group games can lead to more positive impressions of group members and, in turn, higher levels of cooperation. A study was conducted with 42 participants, aged 7 to 12 y/o, to perform one of the following group activities: Play an Energetic or a Relaxing Dance Game, or; Perform a Group Conversation. Afterwards, participants evaluated their self and group affective impressions. A Reward-sharing task was conducted to evaluate Group Trust levels and Cooperative Dispositions. Participants in both Game Group conditions significantly perceived their group members as more energetic and displayed higher Group Trust levels than participants in the Group Conversation condition. The more energetic participants perceived their group members, the higher were their group trust levels. Results suggest that, by influencing group energy impressions, group games can immediately motivate cooperation among children.},

	abstract = {Since its conception in 2017, the Global None in Three (Ni3) Research Centre for the Prevention of Gender Based Violence (GBV) has been working to collect real stories about people's personal experiences of GBV from both victim and perpetrator perspectives. Led by a team of experts
from across the globe, these real-life experiences have been used to inform the development of a series of serious, prosocial computer games whose narratives, in-game dialogue and characters are based around this empirical data. This article discusses the translation of these stories into
the games' digital narratives, and explores how their re-telling is fundamental to the success of the games as educational tools for increasing empathy in players and, ultimately, for changing attitudes and behaviours towards GBV. In doing so, it explores the coexistence and fluctuating
relationship between digital narratives and the spoken word ‐ whose significance might be seen to book-end the None in Three project as a whole, in its development of the game and in the dissemination of its message about preventing gender-based violence.},

	abstract = {Serious games with interactive narratives have been studied for their potential to influence emotions, behaviors and attitudes concerning real-world people and issues. Past research suggests that the meaningfulness of a narrative is potentially determined by the level of consequence following choices within the narrative. These choices may be the key to improving the effectiveness of an interactive narrative for prosocial outcomes such as improving perceptions towards racial outgroup members. This study examined how consequential and inconsequential choices in meaningful game narratives influence prosocial outcomes towards racial outgroups, as well as the level of meaningfulness perceived by players. Participants in the pre-post experimental study played a newly developed serious game and generally showed improved perceptions towards racial others after gameplay. However, there were no significant differences with regards to prosocial outcomes and perceived meaningfulness of the game narrative between consequential and inconsequential choice conditions of the game.},

	abstract = {Violence is a major element in many of the present-day's digital games. Despite the extensive research on this subject, the effect of violent digital games on the aggression level among children has not been satisfactorily clarified. The study examines the combined effect of collaborative/competitive game strategy and the presence or absence of violence in the game on the aggression of young adolescents. Fifty-six young adolescents (28 girls, 28 boys) aged 10--13 years old participated in this study. They played digital games and answered questionnaires designed to check the influence of the game on their aggression level immediately after the game. Findings indicate that game strategy may have a significant effect on aggression level: collaborative game strategy was found to repress aggression, whereas competitive strategy was found to raise aggression levels among all subjects. The very existence of violence in the game was not found to be responsible for the aggression level of players. No differences in player aggression levels were found between genders.},

	abstract = {Video games have traditionally held a dubious reputation in the media and have been linked to many antisocial behaviors. A large amount of research has borne out some of these concerns, linking video games with addiction and particularly aggression. However, recent work in this area has begun to examine the positive aspects of video gaming. In this work, we examine how playing casual, low-involvement video games with an outgroup member may reduce prejudice. In Study 1, participants played cooperatively or competitively with a (trivial) outgroup member or alone. In Studies 2 and 3, a meaningful social identity was used: students' university affiliation. Participants played either cooperatively with a rival university student against the computer, or alone. Analyses of all three studies showed that attitudes toward the outgroup were more positive after playing with an outgroup member compared with control conditions. How these findings may be applied to real world groups and extensions for future research are then discussed.},

@article{Downing2016,
	abstract = {A limited body of literature has explored popular media portrayals of the prison experience. Much of this literature has focussed on film and television. Scant literature has considered new forms of media such as video games' portrayals of the prison experience. In the current inquiry we examine the computer simulation game, Prison Architect, with respect to how its interactive experience has the potential simultaneously portray and problematize pains of imprisonment, and how these portrayals and problematizations may prompt a public discourse surrounding prison, particularly from a peacemaking perspective, even if the game itself does not incorporate concepts such as restorative justice. To conduct this analysis, we examine game-developer video blogs that relayed information about the game as it was developed (e.g., game content, rationale for creation, and embedded political, social and philosophical orientations toward prisons, prisoners, and the prison-industrial complex). Ultimately we link pains of imprisonment in Prison Architect to the broader societal discourse surrounding rationales for incarceration (i.e., retribution, incapacitation, and rehabilitation) and consider implications for prison themed games, particularly those such as simulation games that afford players a broad degree of freedom, as vehicles through which to engage the public in discourse about prison that can adopt a more human-centered, peace-oriented approach.},

@article{Saleme2020,
	abstract = {Purpose Gamification has gained popularity in social marketing research; however, its application remains limited to a few contexts, and relatively little is known about how innovative gamification technologies such as augmented reality can be applied to social marketing programme design. This paper aims to demonstrate the application of gamification to a social marketing pilot programme designed to increase children's empathy and empathic behaviour. Design/methodology/approach Informed by social cognitive theory (SCT), a mixed-method research design was adopted using pre- and post-programme surveys (n = 364) to assess effectiveness using paired samples t-test. Qualitative data included observations, participant's questions and a feedback activity at the end of the programme. A thematic analysis was undertaken to examine the data and detect meaningful insights. Findings Children's affective empathy and empathic behaviour outcomes were improved following the pilot programme. However, no effects were observed for cognitive empathy and social norms. Thematic analysis revealed three themes to further improve the game: developmentally appropriate design, user experience and game design. Research limitations/implications Findings demonstrated challenges with the application of SCT outlining a disconnect between the design of the gamified programme and theory application. Practical implications This study provides initial evidence for the application of innovative gamification technologies to increase empathy in children. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first to examine how a gamified social marketing programme can increase empathy in children.},

The findings revealed a transformative potential for ICTs far beyond original expectations.

Ninety-five preschool children from three schools played two interactive games: a especially designed emotion game and a control game for a touch screen device. The increase in scores in recognising the emotion faces from pre-test to post-test is significant for girls when playing the emotion game, with especially large increases in scores from girls from the most deprived school. The boys scored higher for collaborative play and also scored significantly higher than girls at recognising anger but girls were better at recognising fear. Qualitative analysis using the Talk Taken Down technique showed more egocentric than social dialogue but also more non-verbal expressions of cooperation and enjoyment than verbal interaction with the game. The study concludes by suggesting seven design considerations for designing prosocial, collaborative games.},

Satisfaction of the psychological needs of competence, relatedness, positive-emotions, and enjoyment was examined as possible mediator of the hypothesized effect of cooperative violent game on prosociality. The sample was composed of 845 nine to twelve-year-olds who were randomly allocated to a 2 (game content: violent versus neutral) X 2 (game mode: single-versus co-player) between-subjects design. After playing one type of video game, the participants were asked to engage in two types of prosocial tasks where they could provide assistance to the experimenter and donate money to charity. Compared to the single-player conditions, the participants in the cooperative conditions engaged in more prosocial behaviors. The violent co-player condition was associated with more helping behaviors than the neutral co-player condition. Increased satisfaction of psychological needs was shown to act as a mediator. The social context and the psychological experience influenced the participants' prosocial behavior more than the formal content of the game.},

Data were analyzed both in terms of the whole sample and separately according to participant sex. The results provide partial evidence that there are links between violent games and aggressive attitudes (i.e., physical, but not relational, aggression); aggressive driving games and aggressive driving tendencies/punitive attitudes toward a convicted driver; violent games and hostile attribution bias; and violent games and lower empathy ratings. No support was found for the link between prosocial games and higher empathy. Future research directions for research on video games effects are outlined.},

In single-player games, this aspect is often missing. Advancements in speech recognition now open new potentials for voice-activated single-player experiences. In this work, we integrated voice interaction to a single-player virtual reality (VR) game. To create a sense of team spirit, we enabled players to talk to a multiplicity of agents using natural language. We hypothesize that conversing with only one agent cannot produce the same level of camaraderie. We conducted a preliminary qualitative user study (N=10) to explore how players experience talking with the in-game characters in the single-agent and the multi-agent condition. Early results suggest that our participants prefer interacting with the group of interlocutors. They perceived the multi-agent condition as more entertaining and liked the feeling of being part of a team.},

In the current article, we seek to bridge the gap between the video game effects literature and the intergroup processes literature by proposing that intergroup competition and cooperation in online video games may influence intergroup attitudes and behavior, with real world implications for both studying and reducing intergroup conflicts. First, we review pertinent theory and literature regarding intergroup competition and cooperation, followed by work on video game context effects. Next, we describe how intergroup competition and cooperation in online video games may impact intergroup processes. Finally, we propose important directions for future research and discuss the implications of this work.},

	abstract = {Objective: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often display problematic and excessive videogame play. Using active videogames (AVGs) may have physical benefits, but its effects on socialization are unknown.Materials and Methods: We conducted an A-B-A' experiment comparing sedentary videogames and AVGs for three dyads of a child with ASD and his sibling. An augmented reality (AR) game was used to introduce AVGs. Sessions were coded for communication, positive affect, and aggression.Results: One dyad had increases in positive affect with AVGs. Otherwise, social behaviors were unchanged or worse. The AR game demonstrated consistent elevations in social behaviors.Conclusions: Use of AVGs has inconsistent effects on social behavior for children with ASD. Further research is needed to understand mediators of response to AVGs. AR games should be evaluated for potential benefits on socialization and positive affect.},

The main finding is that collaborative game play significantly increases cooperative behavior, especially in prosocial individuals. In addition, a mediation model is established in which trust partially mediates the association between the game mode and cooperative behavior. The results indicate that playing collaborative games increases cooperation in prosocial people partially by facilitating the trust they have in their gaming partners. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.},

	abstract = {In this work we use complex systems methodologies to analyze quantitatively the impact of an intervention involving cooperative and self-awareness activities on social interactions in children. The aim of this study is to evaluate behavioral plasticity of social relationships between peers in 6-7 year-olds who participated in the intervention conducted in a school context. The intervention consisted of 8 one-hour long sessions comprising mindfulness-based practices, collaborative activities that required cooperation, and perspective-taking instances in which children shared feelings, perceptions, and needs felt during the activities. We used complex network and game theory to evaluate pre-post-intervention variations. Social relationship was analyzed with a sociogram in both the intervention group and a control group which continued with regular classes. By means of the sociometric questionnaire we asked each child to mention which classmates he/she would choose as playmates and which he/she would not. Changes in the number of peers selected and rejected reflected changes in the pattern of social relationships pre-post-intervention. Our findings show that participating in the intervention positively modulated social interactions since we found an increase in the diversity and quality of positive links and a reduction in negative ones; a higher level of integration, indicated by enhanced positive networks where children with many positive connections tended to connect with those with few links; and more positive interactions between genders. These findings were not observed in the control group. Through the use of the mentioned methodologies, the current investigation provides new quantitative evidence of social network plasticity in children, an important topic which, to our knowledge, has been little studied. Results from this work indicate that positive transformations in social relationships can be fostered through the performance of this kind of intervention.},

	abstract = {The studies existing on the effects of video games with violent content and aggression in research literature have controversial results. Accordingly, some studies indicate that empathy may play a determining role in the relationship between video games and aggression. In this context, the study aim was to describe the game types that middle school students play and analyze the relationship between the game types, their reactive and proactive aggressions, and empathic skills. Participants were 318 students from middle schools in Turkey. An important finding obtained from this study was the relationship between the frequency of proactive and reactive aggression and the playing of aggressive games; a relationship was also identified between emotional and cognitive empathy and the playing of aggressive games. Therefore, it is important to talk to children about the real-life consequences of aggressive games, and teach them appropriate methods of conflict management that they can use in real-life conflicts, which may diminish the negative effects of games with aggressive content.},

	abstract = {Playing video games is a pervasive activity among middle school students. Researchers are now investigating whether such play carries any educational benefits. One aspect of many video games is teamwork. The goal of the present research was to investigate whether playing video games cooperatively with or competitively against others affects later teamwork behavior and team performance. 60 middle school students, all without previous video game playing experience, participated in the present study. They were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: no video game playing, cooperative video game playing, and competitive video game playing. Those in the video game conditions then were taught how to play Modern Warfare 3 and played for two hours. They were randomly paired with another subject from the same condition and either played with or against that person. Two weeks later, all participants were randomly paired with new partners from the same experimental condition and played a Prisoner's Dilemma game where points are awarded to players based on whether they play cooperatively or competitively with each other. Total team scores were tallied after 20 trials. Results showed that those who played Modern Warfare 3 cooperatively scored the highest, while those who played it competitively scored the lowest. Results suggest that video game playing can bolster teamwork and team performance when played cooperatively and impair teamwork and team performance when played competitively.},

The adjustment of such software might support learning, especially in complex settings like collaborative or cooperative scenarios. Coming from a theoretical background of educational psychology, our experiment seeks to implement the ``jigsaw strategy'' within educational videogames. We conducted an experiment with sixty participants to compare conditions with or without increased task interdependence through the jigsaw strategy (i.e., the distribution of game elements and essential information). The participants had to rebuild a house from the 1894 novel Effi Briest within an adjusted version of the ``sandbox'' game Minecraft. The results show increased play performance, and learning outcomes with increased task interdependence. We conducted mediator and moderator analysis, which revealed a strong impact of play performance on learning outcomes. Additional analyses of mental effort, cognitive load, and efficiency allowed for deep insights into the playing and learning process. These insights enrich current theories about collaboration, mental strain, and the working memory effect and highlight the applicability of collaborative mechanics within educational videogames.},

	abstract = {Children who have experienced institutional care early in life tend to show deficits in behavioral and adrenocortical regulation that impact their ability to form friendships and have positive social interactions with peers. Understanding how post-institutionalized children interact with unfamiliar peers and the factors that predict the quality of these interactions may shed light on the processes contributing to the persistent, often increasing social deficits seen in post-institutionalized children. In this study, one child (either post-institutionalized or non-adopted; the ``target'') interacted with another non-adopted child (the ``peer''; N = 58 dyads, M age = 9.65 years) through a series of competitive and cooperative games during which interaction quality and affect of each participant were coded. Three saliva samples were also collected from each participant to measure cortisol production across the session. No group differences in behavior, affect, or cortisol were found. However, non-adopted target children's affect was positively associated with their peers' affect and negatively associated with peers' change in cortisol across the session, while post-institutionalized target children's affect was not associated with their peers' affect or cortisol. Thus, future interventions may want to promote social skills in children exposed to early adversity by focusing on dyadic social contingencies rather than individual behavior.},

Previous research on social behaviour in relation to playing videogames has often focused on either cooperation (playing in pairs against the game) or competition (playing alone against other players); however, videogames, particularly multiplayer online games, often include both. This study investigates prosocial behaviour in videogames with both cooperative and competitive elements---team-based player versus player (PvP) games---and aims to examine whether the amount of time spent playing these games is related to in-game prosocial behaviour. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 727 respondents and results were analysed using conditional process modelling. No significant direct or indirect relationship between the amount of time spent playing team-based PvP games and in-game prosocial behaviour was found. However, an exploratory linear regression analysis revealed a significant, positive relationship between in-game and offline prosocial behaviour. Implications and recommendations for future research are discussed.},

	abstract = {This cross-sectional study examined the differential associations between attachment patterns and empathy and children's and adolescents' aggressive, prosocial and interpersonal video game play and peer relations. The sample was composed of 1391 Israeli children and adolescents, aged 9--15 who rated their recent video-game involvement in terms of violent, prosocial and interpersonal interactions. Dispositional attachment styles and empathy were measured, as well as social satisfaction, prosociality, peer support, subjective well-being, and aggressive behavior in daily life. The results confirmed the relationship between type of video game involvement, social functioning, and well-being. Prosocial and interpersonal video game play were related to greater social satisfaction, peer support, and prosocial behavior, which led to increased well-being, whereas violent video game play was related to increased school bullying, and lower social satisfaction and prosociality. Secure attachment was related to increased empathic concerns and higher levels of prosocial and interpersonal interactions in video game use. Children with attachment anxiety or avoidance engaged in significantly less prosocial video game behavior. These findings challenge the assumption that violence in video games is inevitably related to negative social consequences and points to the potential of video games to serve basic attachment and prosocial needs that can promote close relations.},

	abstract = {Due to the general gamification of our culture and society as well as the proliferation of games in our everyday activities, people are increasingly looking at games and gamification as a source for cooperation and other prosocial behaviors. However, not all game features lead to increased cohesion, cooperation or collaboration between people. While some games indeed are geared for cooperation, majority of games also aim toward competition or just non-social activity. Therefore, a prominent research problem exists in understanding how different game and gamification design may lead to altruistic sentiment and collective action. In this study, we investigated how the engagement with cooperative game features relates to the emergence of altruism and whether altruism leads to the formation of we-intentions in a gaming context. We employed data gathered among players of the augmented reality game Ingress (N=206) and analyzed the data using PLS-SEM. The results show that game features can give rise to altruism and that altruism can invoke we-intentions via cooperative goal structures (we-goals) of individuals. In addition to providing important insights regarding how cooperation emerges within games, this study provides implications for cultivating cooperation by gamification.},

In the present study, we investigated whether (AR) games induced empathy, mood, and affect. Participants were recruited from a northern Florida University, and empathy was measured by a scale that captured both cognitive and emotional empathy. Mood was directly assessed using a standardized scale that measures both positive and negative affect. Participants took part in both a Pok{\'e}mon Go and a Control conditions (walked outside without playing an AR game). Primary findings include a decrease in negative affect after participants played Pok{\'e}mon Go, but not in the Control condition. The second finding was that playing Pok{\'e}mon Go did not lead to an increase in empathy; however, some aspects of emotional empathy were different in the Control condition. This finding has important implications for individuals who struggle with anxiety and depression.},

	abstract = {Cooperation in repeated games has been widely studied in experimental settings; however, the duration over which players participate in such experiments is typically confined to at most hours, and often to a single game. Given that in real world settings people may have years of experience, it is natural to ask how behavior in cooperative games evolves over the long run. Here we analyze behavioral data from three distinct games involving 571 individual experiments conducted over a two-year interval. First, in the case of a standard linear public goods game we show that as players gain experience, they become less generous both on average and in particular towards the end of each game. Second, we analyze a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma where players are also allowed to make and break ties with their neighbors, finding that experienced players show an increase in cooperativeness early on in the game, but exhibit sharper "endgame" effects. Third, and finally, we analyze a collaborative search game in which players can choose to act selfishly or cooperatively, finding again that experienced players exhibit more cooperative behavior as well as sharper endgame effects. Together these results show consistent evidence of long-run learning, but also highlight directions for future theoretical work that may account for the observed direction and magnitude of the effects.},

	abstract = {Video games are one of the most popular media forms in today's society, but are often criticized for various reasons. For instance, mainstream video games do not incorporate enough racially diverse game characters or are often connected to adolescents' levels of aggression and have thus been the focus of many debates. While the negative consequences of video games have been analyzed by many academic studies, research on the prosocial effects of video games is scarce. To address this research gap and support the ongoing call for more diverse video game characters, this study used a 3 × 1 between-subjects design (N = 86) to test the impact of racially diverse non-playable characters (NPCs). The parasocial contact hypothesis was used as the theoretical foundation, incorporating virtual reality technology as an intensifier of effects. The results showed that helping a Black NPC did not reduce implicit bias, but reduced explicit bias towards Black people. This improvement was stronger when the video game was played using virtual reality technology than when using a traditional two-dimensional gaming device.},

However, social game play is becoming more popular than solo game play, and research suggests cooperative game play is beneficial for players. The current studies explore the effects of cooperative game play on player's subsequent aggressive behaviors toward video game partners (Experiment 1) and non-video game partners (Experiment 2), while providing a discussion of possible theories applicable to social video game play. Cooperative games resulted in less aggression between video game partners (Experiment 1) and between non-video game partners (Experiment 2) than did competitive or stand-alone games. Interestingly, cooperative game play and no-game play produced similar levels of aggression (Experiment 1), whereas competitive and solo game play produced similar levels of aggression (Experiment 2). These findings are consistent with the theory of bounded generalized reciprocity. Playing violent games cooperatively can offset the aggression-increasing effects of violent video games.},

In this experiment, we manipulated two aspects of a virtual partner's identity---race and task collaboration---to determine how users would perceive others in a virtual world. White participants (N=99) played an anagram game competitively (outgroup) or cooperatively (ingroup) in a virtual environment with a black (outgroup) or white (ingroup) virtual partner. Contrary to hypotheses, performing either task led to more positive evaluations of black avatars than white avatars.},

We propose that interactive playgrounds are vehicles for playful cooperation when robots are integrated into the system as cooperative co-players. We developed the Hatch 'em all game, wherein children are encouraged to hatch eggs cooperatively with a robot, and tested the effect of the robot's cooperative behavior on the children. We found that when the robot played cooperatively, children cooperated and helped the robot more than when the robot played selfishly. Our findings suggest that the social affordances of the playground, together with the social interactions between the children and the robot, enabled instances of team cooperation and prosocial behavior. Our work contributes to the CSCW community by opening a novel avenue for supporting children's cooperation, which could serve as a future testbed to investigate the role of robots in cooperative interaction},

	abstract = {Seamless cooperation between individuals is essentially a crucial aspect of any successful endeavor. A host of literature has been published in the academic realm about how cooperation could be cultivated. However, true cooperation often forms organically without external enforcement. Recently, there has been one special example of a context where cooperation seemed to have effortlessly sprung up between people who might not even have had previous connections. The context is video/online games; games such as Ingress, Pok{\'e}mon Go, and World of Warcraft bind people together to work against insurmountable odds and to overcome jointly held challenges. Organizations of many types have recently begun to gamify their structures and services in order to cultivate such seamless cooperation. However, before this potential of games can be successfully wielded outside video games, we need to understand better how games are able to cultivate such cooperation. Therefore, in this study we investigate how games can induce and cultivate we-intention of working as a group. Specifically, we investigate how cooperative game features affect different forms of group dynamics and how they further translate into we-intentions. We employ data from users of the augmented reality game Ingress (N = 206). The results show that cooperative game features induce we-intentions via positively increasing group norms, social identity, joint commitment, attitudes toward cooperation, and anticipated positive emotions. The findings imply that practitioners who are looking to increase cooperation should find that gamification inspired by cooperative game design is beneficial and preferable over individual-based gamification efforts.},

The action research was done at an intentionally culturally and socio-economically diverse Montessori school in St. Paul, Minnesota. The 23 children involved were all children from the three to six age group who take daily naps. I recorded every aggressive incident I saw before, during, and after the intervention. I also recorded what cooperative activities I introduced for the intervention. Once before and after the intervention I asked the children if they enjoyed recess. I recorded observational notes such as weather conditions, and what activities the children chose each day. The data did not show that the cooperative games had a significant effect on the number of aggressive incidents recorded. Many more boys than girls were involved in aggressive incidents. There was no significant change in how the children reported their enjoyment of recess. Aggressive behavior could possibly be reduced through another action research project with a longer intervention period, a conflict resolution plan, and more purposeful activities for the children outside.},

	abstract = {Many adolescents play video games together with their friends for multiple hours per week. The way in which peers play games may influence their interactions and relationship. Research has shown distinct effects of competitive and cooperative play on aggression, prosocial behavior, and feelings of empathy and trust. The current study investigated the effect of the mode of gaming on adolescents' behavior during gaming, as well as their friendship quality and prosocial behavior afterwards, in a field study with experimental design and naturalistic observations. Adolescent friend dyads played a racing video game either solitary, competitively, or cooperatively. Observers coded participants' behavior during the gaming sessions, while friendship quality and prosocial behavior towards the friend were measured afterwards. Results showed that playing a game competitively lowered friendship quality. Furthermore, the mode of play changed the participants' behavior during game play, with more positive, negative, and hierarchical behavior observed in the cooperative condition. Additionally, positive and prosocial behavior displayed during the gaming session predicted higher friendship quality afterwards. There were no effects on the subsequent prosocial behavior task. This study illustrates that both the mode in which friends play a video game and the behavior displayed during gaming influence friendship quality.},

@inproceedings{Apostolakis2017,
	abstract = {Personalization and maintenance of high levels of engagement still remain two of the main challenges in the design of serious games. Towards this end, in this paper we propose a novel adaptation approach for both online and offline adaptation in prosocial games. In this paper, we describe the implementation of an artificial intelligence driven adaptation manager, whose purpose is to direct players towards game content the players are most likely to enjoy (measured in their engagement responses). As a consequence, we demonstrate how the adaptation manager can be used to increase the chances of players attaining the game's specific prosocial learning objectives. Each mechanism (offline and online) processes different information about the player and concerns different types of factors affecting engagement and prosocial behavior. More specifically, the online mechanism maintains a player engagement profile for game elements related to the provision of Corrective Feedback and Positive Reinforcement, in order to adapt existing game content in real time. On the other hand, off-line adaptation matches players to game scenarios according to the players' prosocial ability and the game scenarios' ranking. The efficiency of the proposed adaptation manger as a tool for enhancing students' prosocial skills development is demonstrated through a small scale experiment, under real-conditions in a school environment, using the prosocial game of Path of Trust.},

	abstract = {Many college students find themselves struggling with mental health problems (ACHA, 2015). Individuals with mental illness not only battle with the disease, but with the stigma society has developed toward them, leading to a diminished quality of life. Education and contact are two antistigma approaches utilized in this study (Corrigan \& Watson, 2002). This thesis aims to understand players' involvement in the video game narrative (i.e., narrative engagement and transportation) and its relationship with empathy and attitudes toward people with mental illness. As a way to alleviate stigma, college students (N = 97) were surveyed after playing the video game Fran Bow that was perceived by a focus group as having low in-game stereotypes. Contrary to prediction, results indicated that the video game did not have an effect on participants' empathy or attitudes toward people with mental illness. However, an exploratory assessment of media user characteristics offers interesting insights to the results. Additionally, findings suggest that those who were more involved in the narrative held more in-game story consistent beliefs. Overall, these results imply that video games can play an important role in prosocial change; however, the nature of the game and player characteristics may influence outcomes, therefore more research is needed.},

@book{Parsons2018,
	abstract = {The ProsocialLearn project aims to create a new digital gaming genre that focuses on supporting children (aged 7 to 10 yrs) to acquire prosocial skills necessary for positive relationships, team working, trustworthiness and emotional intelligence (EI).
This Deliverable describes the third evaluation phase which focuses on the activities conducted in school conditions in order to evaluate children's behavioural and experiential responses to game play. The evaluation activities conducted in the UK, Greece, Italy and Spain and their findings are described and discussed. A total of 301 8 to 10-year-old children were involved in in-depth studies in the UK, Greece and Italy, with a further 73 children, aged 9-12 years, involved in less intensive data collection in Spain.
From the study in the UK, which involved 25 children, despite the absence of statistically significant difference, the small sample from Group 1 (n=12) showed increases in their self-perception median scores from Assessment T1 to Assessment T3, indicating a slight tendency towards higher self-perception ratings for these children after the PSL game play sessions. This was the group of children who played the PSL games for the longer period (4 weeks) compared to the comparison group (2 weeks) where no changes were found. Children's nomination of peers (sociometric data) also revealed some changes in a positive direction for some of the main categories (`Cooperative', `Popular' or `Good at school work') between Assessment T1 to Assessment T3.
From the study in Greece, which involved 185 children, the findings from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (prosocial domain) showed significant increases in teachers' ratings between the three points of assessment for all children. However, the ratings were slightly lower from Assessment T2 to Assessment T3, suggesting that the effect may not be very stable. This could also be test-retest reliability issue for the SDQ over short periods of time. In addition, there were slight differences with the sociometric data (peers' nomination), as the mean scores in specific categories (i.e. `Cooperative' or `Athletic') were higher between Assessment T1 to T2, suggesting some effect. Significant difference for the category of `Leader' during Assessment T1, T2 and T3 for Class 1, showed that children received higher nominations on this characteristic between the three points of assessment.
In the Italian study, which involved 91 children, we could not report on the findings from the prosocial domain of the SDQ. Nevertheless, children's self-perception scores for one of the schools (Orange) increased significantly from Assessment T1 to Assessment T3, suggesting that there was a positive effect on self-perceptions associated with playing the PSL games. The sociometric data (peer nominations) were analysed for only one class (out of four) due to time constraints, and revealed no significant differences.
Overall, there were some positive indications from prosocial measures in the UK, Greece and Italy that children benefitted prosocially from playing the PSL games. In some cases, these indications were based on teacher ratings of children's prosociality (SDQ for teachers), and in other cases based on children's ratings of themselves and others (Self-Perception Profile for Children, Peer Nomination form). In terms of usability and acceptability, the two games for which we have the most data are `Laika' and `Pushy Paddles'. Children really enjoyed their exposure to these games and appreciated the opportunities to work collaboratively with their peers. Teachers were also positive about these games and could see that children enjoyed them, while they provided useful feedback about how the games could be used for supporting learning in the classroom. Children also enjoyed the `Lost in Space' and `Tower Together' games in the Spanish study with less in-depth data collection. Although, teachers were less positive, mostly due to technical problems experienced when playing these games, overall, children and teachers accepted (most of) the games as enjoyable and valid tools that could be used in the classroom context to support children's learning.
The analysis and data presented in this Deliverable are preliminary based on the very short time period provided for writing up the evaluation activities. There is substantial analysis that can be conducted following the end of the project. Given the scale and complexity of the data any further analysis will take a substantial period of time to complete and, hence, is beyond the scope of the current timeframe of the project and the content of this deliverable.},

Twelve college students participated in six approximately 4-hour gaming sessions using a customized game system based on Dungeons \& Dragons{\texttrademark} (D\&D, 1974, 4th ed.). The games contained embedded social/moral dilemmas (e.g., whether to torture a prisoner for information) that participants encountered and had to work through as a group. Significant growth in moral development, as measured with the Defining Issues Test and the Self-Understanding Interview was demonstrated in the gaming groups, but was not replicated in two control groups, who did not participate in the gaming sessions. This suggests that imaginative role-play gaming structures can function as an engaging, interactive ``moral training ground,'' a medium that promotes moral development, and highlights the difference between antisocial and prosocial violence.},

The present studies investigated the influence of an interactive computer game about living in poverty on attitudes and beliefs about the poor. Playing the poverty game was compared to playing a control game and merely observing the poverty game. In Study 1, playing an interactive poverty game did not influence attitudes while watching someone else play the game increased positive attitudes, empathic concern, and support for government-funded anti-poverty policies. In Study 2, meritocracy beliefs moderated the influence of the game; people lower in meritocracy showed less positive attitudes toward the poor after playing the poverty game. This effect was mediated by an increase in the belief that poverty is personally controllable. Future directions for and implications of studying the unique intergroup effects of games are discussed.},

This work examined the electrophysiological features of the prosocial video game effect on prosociality by using a help-needed decision task. Seventy participants played either prosocial or neutral video games for 20 min and then participated in an event-related potential (ERP) experiment that estimated the perceived need for help in others and prosocial behavior (i.e., charitable money donated). The results showed no significant differences between the two games in perceived need for help and money donation (prosocial behavior). Moreover, there were inconsistent results for N2 and P300 waves, in which weak evidence was found for larger frontal N2 when help was needed but not offered in the prosocial video game group; however, there were no differences in right-parietal P300 amplitudes. These findings provide no supportive evidence for the general learning model, which proposes that prosocial video games may promote empathy and prosocial-related behaviors. However, we should note the limitation of the small sample size. Further implications and limitations are discussed.},

	abstract = {Previous research has shown that exposure to violent video games increases aggression, whereas exposure to prosocial video games can reduce aggressive behavior. However, little is known about the neural correlates of these behavioral effects. This work is the first to investigate the electrophysiological features of the relationship between playing a prosocial video game and inhibition of aggressive behavior. Forty-nine subjects played either a prosocial or a neutral video game for 20 minutes, then participated in an event-related potential (ERP) experiment based on an oddball paradigm and designed to test electrophysiological responses to prosocial and violent words. Finally, subjects completed a competitive reaction time task (CRTT), which is based on Taylor's Aggression Paradigm and measures both reaction time and noise intensity preference as indices of aggressive behavior. The results show that the prosocial video game group (compared to the neutral video game group) displayed smaller P300 amplitudes, were more accurate in distinguishing violent words, and were less aggressive as evaluated by the CRTT (noise intensity preference). A mediation analysis shows that the P300 amplitude evoked by violent words partially mediates the relationship between type of video game and subsequent aggressive behavior. The results support theories based on the General Learning Model. We provide converging behavioral and neural evidence that exposure to prosocial media may reduce aggression.},

Prosocial gaming has also been used to reduce gender-based violence among young people, but the use of video games to this end as well as evaluations of their effectiveness are rare. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a context-specific, prosocial video game, Jesse, in increasing affective and cognitive responsiveness (empathy) towards victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) among children and adolescents (N = 172, age range 9--17 years, M = 12.27, SD = 2.26). A randomised controlled trial was conducted in seven schools in Barbados. Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental (prosocial video game) or control (standard school curriculum) condition. Experimental and control group enrolled 86 participants each. Girls and boys in the experimental condition, but not their counterparts in the control condition, recorded a significant increase in affective responsiveness after intervention. This change was sustained one week after game exposure. No significant effects were recorded for cognitive responsiveness. Findings suggest that Jesse is a promising new IPV prevention tool among girls and boys, which can be used in educational settings.},

	abstract = {The differences in results across research demonstrate that the social and psychological effects, positive or negative, of video games can be influenced by many variables, including play style and social context (Anderson et al., 2010; Ferguson \& Kilburn, 2010; Greitemeyer and Oswald, 2010; Ewoldsen et al., 2012). The purpose of this study was to determine if face-to-face game play (social context) would result in more prosocial behaviors in both cooperative as well as competitive game play (play style), as compared to online play. Participants played Mario Kart 8 in pairs competitively or cooperatively and online or face-to-face. Participants then played a game where each decided how many dimes to give to the other participant over ten trials in order to measure generosity. A 2x2 between-subjects factorial ANOVA was calculated for the mean number of dimes given to the other participant. Results showed that participants who played the Mario Kart 8 video game under the cooperative play style condition gave significantly more dimes to the other participant (M = 24.96, SD = 8.65) than participants who played the video game under the competitive play style condition (M = 18.67, SD = 8.32). The main effect for whether the video game was played face-to-face or online was not significant (F(1, 90) = 2.19, p {\textless} .05, partial η2 = ..024). Participants who played the video game face-to-face (M = 20.54, SD = 7.52) were not significantly different from participants who played the video game online (M = 23.28, SD = 10.25) in the number of dimes given. Finally, the interaction was not significant. Effects of participants' level of familiarity with one another and comparisons to past research on the effects of play style in video games is discussed.},

The latter focuses on teaching children aged 7-10 the importance of understanding the benefits of cooperation as well as expressing trustworthiness. Gamification of Prosocial Theory has led to several game mechanics being redefined, in order to turn traditional games' elements of competition into cooperation evaluation mechanisms. Using these mechanisms, children are called upon to adapt their gameplay behavior towards expressing prosociality and understanding each other's needs. Our experiments solidify this concept, by showcasing promising indications on the game's potential to help children understand when it is a good idea to adopt a prosocial behavior.},

@article{Kaufman2015,
	abstract = {Prosocial games often utilize a direct, explicit approach to engage players with serious real-life scenarios and present information about key societal issues. This approach, however, may limit a game's persuasive impact and ability to produce beneficial outcomes, particularly when the apparent aims of the game trigger players' psychological defenses or reduce players' potential engagement with -- and enjoyment of -- the game experience. In contrast, the ``Embedded Design'' approach that we introduce here offers effective, evidence-based strategies for more stealthily or covertly delivering persuasive content in a game in a fashion that circumvents players' psychological defenses and triggers a more receptive mindset. This paper provides an in-depth exploration of two key Embedded Design strategies: (1) intermixing: combining ``on-topic'' and ``off-topic'' game content in order to make the focal message or theme less obvious and more accessible and (2) obfuscating: using game genres or framing devices that direct players' attention or expectations away from the game's true aims. To illustrate the implementation and effectiveness of these strategies, we detail the design of two games that utilize a number of these techniques to reduce stereotypes and biases and present the methods and results of a set of empirical studies testing the prosocial impact of these games. In addition, we introduce a number of other Embedded Design strategies that have emerged in our work and discuss the most viable contexts for the use of this design approach.},

Participants were recruited from a large Northwestern city and a moderate city in the Mountain West of the United States. Video games played between siblings were coded by an independent sample to assess levels of physical aggression and prosocial behavior in each game. Playing video games with a sibling was associated with higher levels of sibling affection for both boys and girls, but higher levels of conflict for boys only. Playing a violent video game with a brother was associated with lower levels of conflict in the sibling relationship, whereas playing a prosocial video game was not related to any sibling outcome. The value of video games in sibling relationships will be discussed, with a focus on the type of game and the sex of the adolescent.},

	abstract = {The relationship between different types of video games and male and female adolescent behavior has been widely speculated in the recent past. Research has suggested that violent video games may increase aggressive behavior, and prosocial video games may enhance altruistic behavior (Willoughby, Adachi \& Good, 2012; Greitemeyer, Osswald, \& Brauer, 2010). Bartholow and Anderson (2002) suggested that men may be more influenced by violent video games than women. Interestingly, past research on prosocial video games has not found any gender differences (Gentile et al, 2009). The current study examined the effect of gender on aggressive and prosocial behavior in relation to gaming technology. Participants were given the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire and Self-Report Altruism Scale and randomly assigned to one of the following three games: Monster Shooter 2: Back to Earth, Ants: Mission of Salvation or Super Monkey Ball 2. After playing the designated game, participants engaged in a Prisoner's Dilemma task in order to determine the game's influence on their competitive or cooperative behaviors. A total of forty undergraduate students at Trinity College participated in this research. It was hypothesized that students assigned to Monster Shooter 2: Back to Earth would display more aggressive behavior in the Prisoner's Dilemma task and students assigned to Ants: Mission of Salvation would exhibit more prosocial behavior in the task. I predicted that men would generally display more aggression than women in the Prisoner's Dilemma task, and specifically that men would be more aggressive than women after aggressive game exposure. Additionally, I predicted that there would be no gender difference after altruistic game exposure. Results indicated that exposure to one of the three games did not influence subsequent behavior. Moreover, regardless of game exposure, there were no significant gender differences in behavior in the task. Lastly, there were no significant gender differences in the aggressive game condition or the prosocial game condition.},

In two experiments (N=80 each), inducing empathy by means of a text (Study 1) or a video clip (Study 2) prior to playing a video game caused differential effects on cognitions and behavior depending on the nature of the subsequent video game: The induction had positive effects on participants' behavior (i.e., decreasing antisocial and increasing prosocial behavior) after a prosocial game (Study 1), or when participants played a positive hero character in an antisocial game (Study 2). In contrast, empathy increased antisocial behavior and reduced prosocial behavior after playing a mean character in an antisocial game (Study 1 \& 2).

	abstract = {Acquiring skills for social and emotional well-being is important for inclusive societies and academic achievement. Studies have demonstrated the beneficial link between prosocial behaviours and improved results in curriculum topics. This paper describes a Prosocial Learning (PSL) process for creation and delivery of digital games for children (7-10 yrs) within educational systems that support learning of prosocial skills. The approach combines prosocial pedagogies with advanced ICT technologies and cloud delivery models to create attractive and exciting learning opportunities for children; produce novel digital game-based pedagogies and simplify deployment.},
